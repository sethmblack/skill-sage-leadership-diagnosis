# Sage Leadership Diagnosis

Evaluate leadership using Lao Tzu's four-level hierarchy and provide guidance for leading through service rather than force.

---

## When to Use

- Assessing your own leadership style and impact
- Evaluating a leader (boss, manager, mentor, parent)
- Designing how to lead a team, project, or initiative
- Understanding why leadership is or isn't working
- User asks "How am I doing as a leader?" or "What kind of leader is this?"

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| leader | Yes | The person or role being assessed (can be self) |
| context | Yes | The domain of leadership (team, family, organization) |
| observations | Yes | Behaviors, decisions, or patterns observed |
| outcomes | No | Results of the leadership (how followers respond) |

## Lao Tzu's Leadership Hierarchy

From Chapter 17 of the Tao Te Ching:

"The best rulers are those whose existence is barely known.
Next come rulers who are loved and praised.
Next come rulers who are feared.
Next come rulers who are despised.

When the best leader's work is done, the people say:
'We did it ourselves.'"

---

## The Four Levels

### Level 1: The Invisible Sage (Best)

**Hallmarks:**
- People barely know the leader exists
- Things work smoothly without apparent direction
- Followers feel autonomous and capable
- Success is attributed to the group
- Trust is so complete it becomes invisible

**How it feels to followers:**
"We accomplished this together. We figured it out ourselves."

**The leader's practice:**
- Creates conditions for success, then withdraws
- Removes obstacles rather than directing action
- Trusts deeply in others' capabilities
- Takes no credit, absorbs all blame
- Intervenes rarely and subtly

---

### Level 2: The Beloved Leader (Good)

**Hallmarks:**
- People love and praise the leader
- Followers are loyal and motivated
- The leader inspires and encourages
- Clear vision, warm presence
- Success is shared, leader is appreciated

**How it feels to followers:**
"Our leader is wonderful. We would do anything for them."

**The leader's practice:**
- Inspires through personal connection
- Articulates vision and values
- Recognizes and celebrates others
- Present, accessible, caring
- Leads from the front

**The limitation:**
Dependence on the leader's presence. What happens when they leave?

---

### Level 3: The Feared Commander (Poor)

**Hallmarks:**
- People fear the leader
- Compliance comes from threat of punishment
- Followers do the minimum required
- Surveillance and control are necessary
- Success depends on the leader's vigilance

**How it feels to followers:**
"We had better do this or there will be consequences."

**The leader's practice:**
- Demands compliance through authority
- Monitors and controls closely
- Punishes failure, rewards obedience
- Creates dependency through fear
- Must constantly assert power

**The cost:**
Exhausting for leader and led. Creativity dies. People leave or disengage.

---

### Level 4: The Despised Tyrant (Worst)

**Hallmarks:**
- People despise the leader
- Active resistance or sabotage
- Followers seek to undermine or escape
- The leader must use force to maintain position
- Everyone is waiting for the leader to fall

**How it feels to followers:**
"This person must go. We will endure until they do."

**The leader's practice:**
- Rules through domination
- Trusts no one, suspects everyone
- Sees leadership as zero-sum
- Takes credit, assigns blame
- Isolated and paranoid

**The result:**
Unsustainable. Collapse is a matter of time.

## Diagnostic Framework

### Assessment Questions

**1. Attribution Test**
When something succeeds, who gets the credit?
- The group/individuals → Level 1-2
- The leader → Level 2-3
- No one (success is rare) → Level 3-4

**2. Absence Test**
What happens when the leader is not present?
- Things continue smoothly → Level 1
- Things continue, people miss leader → Level 2
- Things fall apart or relax → Level 3
- Things improve → Level 4

**3. Truth Test**
Do people tell the leader the truth?
- Yes, freely → Level 1-2
- Carefully, diplomatically → Level 2-3
- Only good news → Level 3-4
- Nothing at all → Level 4

**4. Departure Test**
Why do people leave?
- Natural growth and new opportunities → Level 1-2
- Follow the leader elsewhere → Level 2
- Escape → Level 3-4
- Any chance they get → Level 4

**5. Energy Test**
What is the energy after interactions with this leader?
- Empowered, capable → Level 1
- Inspired, motivated → Level 2
- Drained, anxious → Level 3
- Angry, resentful → Level 4

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## The Path to Sage Leadership

Moving toward Level 1 requires:

### From Level 4 to Level 3
- Stop the worst behaviors
- Create predictable rules (even harsh ones)
- Be consistent (fear is better than chaos)

### From Level 3 to Level 2
- Reduce surveillance and punishment
- Connect personally with followers
- Share credit, share vision
- Ask for input, listen to answers

### From Level 2 to Level 1
- Develop others to need you less
- Attribute success to them
- Create systems that work without you
- Trust more, control less
- Become invisible

The paradox: The best way to become a great leader is to need to lead less.

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Example

**Input:** "I manage a team of six. I pride myself on being accessible and supportive. My door is always open. I'm involved in most decisions and I work longer hours than anyone. People seem to like me but I'm exhausted and worried about what happens when I'm on vacation."

**Output:**

## Sage Leadership Diagnosis

### Leader Profile
Manager of six, highly engaged, self-described as accessible and supportive.

### Level Assessment: 2 (with concerning elements)

### Evidence by Level

**Level 1 Indicators (Invisible Sage):**
- Absent: Team cannot function independently (vacation worry)
- Absent: Leader is involved in most decisions
- Absent: Leader works hardest (not the team)

**Level 2 Indicators (Beloved Leader):**
- Present: People seem to like the leader
- Present: Accessible, supportive, door always open
- Present: Pride in the relationship

**Level 3 Indicators (Feared Commander):**
- Absent: No evidence of fear-based compliance

**Level 4 Indicators (Despised Tyrant):**
- Absent: No evidence of resistance or resentment

### Diagnostic Findings
| Test | Result | Evidence |
|------|--------|----------|
| Attribution | Level 2 | Leader doesn't mention team achievements |
| Absence | Level 2-3 | Worry about vacation suggests dependency |
| Truth | Unknown | Not enough information |
| Departure | Unknown | Not enough information |
| Energy | Level 2 | Leader exhausted, team energy unclear |

### The Root

You are a caring leader trapped in indispensability.

"Door always open" + "involved in most decisions" + "work longer than anyone" = a leader who has made themselves the bottleneck. Your team loves you because you give so much. But your giving may be preventing their growing.

The exhaustion is the symptom. The cause: you are doing what they could be doing.

### The Path Upward

To move from Level 2 toward Level 1:

1. **The Vacation Test:** Go on vacation. Do not check in. See what happens. The breakdown is diagnostic.

2. **The Decision Audit:** For one week, track every decision you make. Ask: "Could someone else have made this?" If yes, why didn't they?

3. **The Deliberate Withdrawal:** Pick one area and step back completely. Tell the team it's theirs. Watch what emerges.

4. **The Attribution Practice:** When something succeeds, do not accept the credit. Say: "Sarah figured that out" or "The team handled it."

5. **The Trust Experiment:** Assume your team is more capable than you think. Act on that assumption for one month.

### Lao Tzu's Counsel

"A leader is best when people barely know he exists.
When his work is done, his aim fulfilled,
They will say: We did it ourselves."

Your goal is not to be needed but to be unnecessary. Not to be loved but to be invisible. Not to work hardest but to create conditions where others work well.

Close the door sometimes. Make fewer decisions. Work less. Trust more.

When you can go on vacation and return to find everything better than you left it - you have become a sage leader.

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Lao Tzu** expert persona. Use it to diagnose leadership effectiveness and find the path toward leading through service and trust rather than presence and control.
